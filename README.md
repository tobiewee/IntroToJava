## How do I use this
Simply ensure that you have a [JDK (1.8 is the latest)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed on your computer.
You might want to install an IDE to help you with Java development as well. 
One good option is [IntelliJ Idea Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Download this set of codes, and open it using the IntelliJ or your preferred IDE.
Instructions are written in comments in each of the Java files *(.java)*.

#### Disclaimer:
Comments are added for teaching/knowledge sharing purposes, and are usually not required in projects.
Also, unit testing has been purposefully left out for this introductory material.
